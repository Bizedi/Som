A nutritious breakfast is essential for children's growth, development, and academic performance. It provides the energy and nutrients needed for physical activities, learning, and maintaining good health. Here are some delicious and nutritious breakfast ideas tailored for growing children.

- Have better nutrient intake throughout the day

## Quick and Easy Breakfast Ideas

### 1. Oatmeal with Fruit and Nuts
- Cook oats with milk or water
- Top with sliced bananas, berries, and a handful of nuts
- Add a sprinkle of cinnamon for flavor

### 2. Whole Grain Toast with Avocado and Eggs
- Toast whole grain bread
- Mash avocado on top
- Add a poached or scrambled egg
- Sprinkle with salt and pepper

### 3. Greek Yogurt Parfait
- Layer Greek yogurt with granola and fresh fruit
- Add a drizzle of honey
- Include nuts or seeds for extra crunch

### 4. Smoothie Bowl
- Blend fruits like bananas, berries, and mango

### 5. Whole Grain Pancakes

- Top with fruit and a small amount of maple syrup

## Tips for Healthy Breakfast Preparation

### Make Ahead Options
- Prepare overnight oats the night before

### Involve Your Children
- Let kids help choose ingredients

## Cultural Considerations

In Somali culture, breakfast often includes traditional foods like:

- Yogurt-based dishes

You can modernize these traditional foods by adding nutritious elements like whole grains and fresh produce.

Remember, the key to successful breakfast habits is consistency and making it enjoyable for your child. Start with small changes and build from there.
