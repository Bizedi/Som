**Gossip** is the act of talking about a person or a group of people who are not present, often discussing matters that may include information unknown to others.

Let us ask ourselves: **why do human beings gossip about one another?**

Experts in social sciences explain that, in the early stages of human existence, people were social creatures who sought ways to survive collectively as groups. This group survival was founded on relationships and social bonds.

For such cooperation to function, it was essential for individuals to know what was happening around them—what events in their environment could affect them. For example:

* Who possessed better hunting tools than others,
* Who controlled areas where wild animals were found,
* Who lived near caves that could be used as shelter,
* Who among the nearby people were enemies,
* Who were deceitful, and who could be trusted.

It was never possible to ensure survival without knowing such information. Likewise, it was impossible to establish relationships without understanding the nature of the people around you.

From this, we clearly understand that human interaction did not advance primarily through complex calculations or deep philosophical mastery. Rather, it evolved through constant communication—talking, sharing information, discussing what was said, and what happened.

This exchange of information is what has connected societies since ancient times.

Psychologists have also found that the majority of people are either listeners of gossip or active participants in it.

However, the common perception that gossip and incitement are mainly associated with women differs from reality. When men gossip or attempt to create conflict, they often do so collectively. For instance, if three, four, or more women gather in one place to gossip about someone, they tend to speak all at once, sharing the conversation collectively.

Other studies indicate that, on average, a person spends **52 minutes per day gossiping**. Of this time, **90%** of what is said about others tends to be negative or unfavorable, focusing on aspects such as a person’s behavior, knowledge, lifestyle, or similar traits.

It is also important to note that people who engage in gossip often feel that they possess exclusive or hidden information unknown to others. When someone believes they hold information, they experience a sense of power.

If information is power, then gossip is the fuel that drives that power.

A clear example of this can be seen on social media. Let us observe our Somali communities:\
The people most frequently talked about are public figures—*he said this, she said that, this happened to them, they separated, they divorced, they were robbed*, and so on.

Such sensational and exaggerated stories are **six times more common** than truthful reports addressing the same subjects.

Be aware that the worst and most widespread sources of character assassination fall into **three categories**:

1. Those who use fake names and stolen images,
2. Those who live outside Somalia,
3. And those who live inside Somalia but whose words carry no accountability or substance.

So, what do you call such people?
